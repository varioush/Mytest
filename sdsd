Functional Requirements
1. Task Ingestion
Incoming tasks must be evaluated for previous failures for the same user and target.

If any pending/failed task for the target exists, the new task is dumped into DynamoDB rather than executed.

2. Task Execution Engine
Tasks are executed sequentially for each user per target.

Each target has its own queue and retry loop, independent of others.

Tasks are processed in FIFO order per user.

3. Failure Handling
Failed tasks after 3 attempts (Resilience4j default) are persisted in DynamoDB.

No duplicate processing. Once a task is processed successfully, it must be deleted or marked stale.

4. Retry Logic
Retried with exponential backoff using Resilience4j.

If the target is down, no new requests or retries are triggered for that target.

Retry job for each target is continuously polling and checking readiness.

5. Recovery Handling
If the target comes back online, the system picks the oldest 10 users with pending tasks for that target and processes them.

Each user’s tasks are processed in order before moving to the next batch.

6. Post-processing
Post-operations are performed after task success.

Post-processing failures are retried with backoff.

Task is only removed from the queue if both task and post-processing succeed.

Acceptance Criteria & Test Cases
ID	Test Scenario	Given	When	Then
TC01	Task Ingestion skips execution if target has failures	User has a failed A2 task in DynamoDB	A3 arrives	A3 is saved to DynamoDB instead of executed
TC02	Tasks are executed in FIFO	User has [A1, A2, A3] for target A	A is up	Tasks are processed in the order A1 → A2 → A3
TC03	Independent retry queue per target	Target B is down, target A is up	Retry job runs	A tasks are retried; B tasks are held
TC04	Target recovery resumes processing	B was down, then comes back up	Retry job detects B is healthy	Process oldest 10 users with B tasks
TC05	Tasks are deleted after success	A task A2 is successful	Post-processing is also successful	A2 is deleted from queue
TC06	Post-processing failure triggers retry	A task A1 success, post-op fails	Retry job runs	Post-op is retried with backoff
TC07	Post-processing success completes task	Post-op retry succeeds	Next retry cycle	Task is removed from queue
TC08	Target down halts all its tasks	A is marked down	Retry job runs	All A-related tasks are held
TC09	Duplicate task is not executed again	A2 exists and is done	Same A2 is received	Task is ignored or marked stale
TC10	Mixed tasks from different targets	A, B, C queues have tasks	B comes online	Only B tasks are resumed
