These test cases cover various success scenarios, failure modes, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive testing of the application's behavior under different conditions. They are designed to validate the application's ability to connect to Kafka using Kerberos, consume messages from multiple topics and clusters, transmit messages to EventBridge, and acknowledge messages back to Kafka, handling any issues gracefully.
