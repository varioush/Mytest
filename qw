Here's a draft for your presentation based on the use case, problem, and AI-based solution. The presentation is structured into key slides with suggested titles and content.

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Title:**
**Accelerating Swift Development with AI Support**
**Subtitle:**
**How Java Developers Delivered iOS Features Using GitHub Copilot**

---

### **Slide 2: Context & Use Case**

**Title:**
**Business Context**
**Content:**

* The UI team was overloaded with feature development tasks.
* To meet timelines, Java backend developers were temporarily allocated to assist with iOS development using Swift.
* Objective: **Re-use existing iOS components (UI, layouts, patterns, etc.)** instead of building from scratch.

---

### **Slide 3: Key Challenge**

**Title:**
**The Core Problem**
**Content:**

* None of the Java developers had prior experience with:

  * iOS platform
  * Swift language
  * Apple Human Interface Guidelines
* Learning curve was steep and time was limited.

---

### **Slide 4: Solution Overview**

**Title:**
**Our Approach: AI-First Development Strategy**
**Content:**

* Adopted **GitHub Copilot** as a virtual Swift mentor and pair programmer.
* Iteratively refined prompts and integrated feedback loops.
* AI assisted in:

  * Translating Java logic into Swift idioms
  * Applying design patterns consistent with existing codebase
  * Maintaining accessibility, font usage, and layout conventions

---

### **Slide 5: AI Prompt Engineering**

**Title:**
**Training GitHub Copilot with Prompt Engineering**
**Content:**

* Multiple iterations of prompt refinement:

  * Provided **contextual code examples**
  * Defined architecture patterns to follow
  * Highlighted what **not** to do (e.g., avoid custom UI unless necessary)
* Prompts evolved from generic to **project-specific**, enhancing relevance and accuracy.

---

### **Slide 6: Implementation Strategy**

**Title:**
**Execution Plan**
**Content:**

* Initial Phase:

  * Shadowed iOS engineers for code walkthroughs
  * Understood reusable components
* AI-Assisted Development Phase:

  * Used Copilot to scaffold and validate Swift code
  * Manual validation by experienced iOS developers before PR approval
* Final Phase:

  * Self-sufficient contribution from Java developers with AI support

---

### **Slide 7: Outcome**

**Title:**
**Results & Achievements**
**Content:**

* Delivered required features **on time**
* Reused 90% of existing layouts, fonts, and components
* Developers became **confident contributors** to Swift codebase
* Demonstrated that **AI + Domain Constraints** = Fast Ramp-up

---

### **Slide 8: Key Takeaways**

**Title:**
**Learnings & Takeaways**
**Content:**
✅ AI can bridge the skill gap effectively when guided with good prompts
✅ Context-aware prompt engineering is **critical**
✅ Copilot served as an on-demand mentor for unknown syntax & conventions
✅ Human review is essential to maintain quality and consistency

---

### **Slide 9: What’s Next?**

**Title:**
**Scaling This Success**
**Content:**

* Develop internal **prompt libraries** per project
* Identify other cross-skill opportunities
* Continuously refine AI integration for onboarding new technologies
